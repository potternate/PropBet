# Building PropBet: A Modern Sports Betting Platform with React and Firebase

As a developer passionate about both sports and technology, I recently built PropBet, a modern web application for NBA player prop betting. In this article, I'll walk through the key decisions and technical challenges that shaped this project.

## The Vision

PropBet was born from a simple observation: existing sports betting platforms often feel cluttered and overwhelming. I wanted to create something different â€“ a clean, focused experience that makes betting on NBA player props intuitive and engaging.

## Technical Stack

For the frontend, I chose React with TypeScript for its robust type safety and excellent developer experience. The decision to use Tailwind CSS was driven by the need for rapid UI development without sacrificing customization. This proved invaluable when implementing features like the dynamic prop cards and bet slip.

## Unique Betting Mechanics

One of PropBet's standout features is its dual betting system:

1. **Power Play**: A traditional parlay system with multipliers up to 37.5x
2. **Flex Play**: An innovative approach that allows partial wins, making the experience less punishing for users

This decision was driven by user feedback indicating that all-or-nothing parlays could be discouraging for casual players.

## Real-Time Updates and State Management

Firebase's Realtime Database powers the application's live updates. This choice was crucial for features like:

- Live odds updates
- Real-time balance changes
- Instant bet settlement

```typescript
// Example of our real-time subscription setup
useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = subscribeToProps((props) => {
    setProps(props.sort((a, b) => 
      new Date(a.gameTime).getTime() - new Date(b.gameTime).getTime()
    ));
  });

  return () => unsubscribe();
}, []);
```

*Real-time updates keep users engaged with the platform*

## Visual Feedback and Progress Indicators

A key enhancement was the addition of visual progress indicators for bet outcomes. The score meter provides immediate visual feedback:

```typescript
function ScoreMeter({ prop, bet }) {
  const max = Math.ceil(prop.line * 1.2);
  const scorePosition = (prop.actualScore / max) * 100;
  
  return (
    <div className="relative h-2 bg-gray-600 rounded-full overflow-hidden">
      <div 
        className={`absolute h-full ${isWinning ? 'bg-emerald-500' : 'bg-red-500'}`}
        style={{ width: `${scorePosition}%` }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This simple yet effective visualization helps users quickly understand their bet outcomes.

## Admin Dashboard

The admin interface was designed with efficiency in mind, featuring:

- Comprehensive prop management
- User account oversight
- Automated prop refreshing
- Detailed bet tracking

## Security and Data Integrity

Security was a top priority. Firebase Authentication handles user management, while Row Level Security ensures data protection. The application implements:

- Email/password authentication
- Balance protection
- Bet verification
- Admin role restrictions

## Mobile-First Design

The entire application was built with mobile users in mind, using a responsive design that works seamlessly across devices:

```typescript
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
  {props.map(prop => (
    <PropCard key={prop.id} prop={prop} />
  ))}
</div>
```

## Lessons Learned

Building PropBet taught valuable lessons about:

1. The importance of real-time feedback in betting applications
2. How to balance feature richness with UI simplicity
3. The value of TypeScript in maintaining large React applications
4. The power of Firebase for real-time applications

## Future Improvements

Looking ahead, I'm considering several enhancements:

- Additional sports and betting types
- Social features for sharing picks
- Advanced statistics and trends
- Machine learning for prop recommendations

## Conclusion

PropBet demonstrates how modern web technologies can create engaging, user-friendly betting experiences. The combination of React, Firebase, and careful UX design resulted in a platform that's both powerful and accessible.
